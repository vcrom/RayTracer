## Basic Ray Tracer

A simple Raytracer following the guidlines of the [Ray Tracing Minibooks](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Ddigital-text&field-keywords=Ray+Tracing+Minibooks) by Peter Shirley.

This is an initial version where I implemented the techniques described in the first book of the series and some of the second. 
I will be adding more features soon ;).
